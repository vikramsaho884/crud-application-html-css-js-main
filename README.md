# CRUD To-Do List Application 📝

This project demonstrates a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed to provide a hands-on example of implementing basic CRUD operations in web applications, making it a perfect starting point for beginners in web development.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file that structures the to-do list application, including the form for adding new tasks and the list where tasks are displayed.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that provides styling to make the application visually appealing and user-friendly.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains all the logic for CRUD operations, including adding new tasks, updating existing tasks, and deleting tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- A text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)

### Running the Application 🏃

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the application.
3. Interact with the application by adding, updating, and deleting tasks as needed.

### Features

- **Create**: Add new tasks with details such as title, description, due date, and priority.
